**Overview**

This notebook follows a structured workflow aligned with the CRISP-DM framework to evaluate classification models for predicting client subscription to a term deposit in a bank marketing dataset. It begins with business and data understanding, followed by exploratory analysis and data preparation. Baseline and simple models are evaluated to establish performance benchmarks, before moving on to tuned models and comparative analysis.

Visualizations and evaluation metrics are selected intentionally to support interpretation and decision-making, with a focus on handling class imbalance and assessing practical trade-offs rather than exhaustively exploring every variable.

**Objective**

The objective of this assignment is to evaluate and compare several classification models: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines, on the Bank Marketing dataset, with the goal of predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit.

Given the low conversion rate for subscriptions, the dataset is strongly imbalanced. As a result, the model evaluation focuses not only on accuracy, but also on recall and precision, with particular emphasis on identifying potential subscribers. The analysis aims to understand both model performance and trade-offs, and to determine which approaches are most suitable for this business context.

**Dataset**

The data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Bank Marketing). It contains client attributes, details of the last campaign contact, campaign history, and broader macroeconomic indicators. The target variable is whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (y).

The original source provides multiple files. In this notebook the following datasets are used:

`bank-additional-full.csv` (41,188 rows) as the primary dataset for EDA and final model evaluation.

`bank-additional.csv` (4,119 rows; ~10%) as a computational shortcut when exploring models that are expensive to tune (notably SVM). Any conclusions based on the reduced dataset are validated against the full dataset where feasible.

**Summary of Findings**

Based on the Bank Marketing dataset and the analysis performed, this project shows that predicting client subscription to a term deposit is strongly affected by class imbalance, making accuracy alone an unreliable evaluation metric. Models that appear to perform well on accuracy may still fail to identify a meaningful number of actual subscribers.

Across the models evaluated, Logistic Regression provided the most practical and reliable performance. While it did not achieve the highest recall by default, it allowed recall to be increased through explicit threshold adjustment, while remaining computationally efficient and interpretable. Other models, such as KNN, Decision Trees, and SVM, were able to achieve comparable or higher recall under certain configurations, but did so with trade-offs that limited their practical usefulness, including higher computational cost, reduced precision, or limited controllability.

Overall, Logistic Regression offered the best balance between predictive performance and real-world applicability for the original business objective.

**Actionable Ideas for the Bank**

Use a lower decision threshold to identify more potential subscribers, accepting a higher number of outreach attempts in exchange for increased conversions.
Treat model outputs as a prioritisation tool rather than a definitive decision, focusing outreach efforts on higher-probability clients.
Monitor the volume of additional contacts generated by lower thresholds to ensure outreach costs remain acceptable.

**Next Steps for Future Modeling**

Perform a cost–benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision threshold based on marketing costs and expected revenue per subscription.
Test the selected model and threshold in a controlled rollout to measure real-world performance before full deployment.
Periodically review and adjust the model as client behaviour and economic conditions change.
